## 📱 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema (Supabase)

```sql
-- Core tables with RLS policies
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  username TEXT UNIQUE,
  verified_seller BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  preferred_language TEXT CHECK (preferred_language IN ('et', 'lv', 'lt', 'en')),
  country TEXT CHECK (country IN ('EE', 'LV', 'LT')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE games (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  bgg_id INTEGER UNIQUE,
  title JSONB, -- Multi-language titles
  year_published INTEGER,
  min_players INTEGER,
  max_players INTEGER,
  playing_time INTEGER,
  image_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE listings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  seller_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  game_id UUID REFERENCES games(id),
  listing_type TEXT CHECK (listing_type IN ('fixed', 'auction', 'trade')),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'EUR',
  condition TEXT CHECK (condition IN ('new', 'like_new', 'very_good', 'good', 'acceptable')),
  location_country TEXT,
  location_city TEXT,
  shipping_options JSONB,
  photos JSONB,
  description JSONB,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('active', 'sold', 'cancelled', 'reserved')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Integration Strategy

#### BoardGamePrices.eu API

```typescript
// Price comparison and suggestions
const getPriceData = async (gameId: string) => {
  const cached = await redis.get(`price:${gameId}`);
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

  const data = await fetch(`${BGPRICES_API}/game/${gameId}`);
  await redis.setex(`price:${gameId}`, 3600, JSON.stringify(data));
  return data;
};
```

#### Shipping APIs

```typescript
// Omniva parcel machine selector
const OmnivaSelector = () => {
  // Map integration with machine availability
  // Real-time rate calculation
  // Label generation
};
```

### Component Architecture

#### Mobile-First Design System

```typescript
// Design tokens implementation
const theme = {
  colors: {
    ivoryMist: "#E6EAD7",
    sunEmber: "#D95323",
    goldenBeam: "#F2C94C",
    forestDeep: "#29432B",
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: "4px",
    sm: "8px",
    md: "16px",
    lg: "24px",
    xl: "32px",
  },
  borderRadius: {
